      I&apos;m a computational enthusiast who&apos;s been tinkering with computers since childhood, when problem-solving meant figuring out why my code wouldn&apos;t compile rather than why my homework wouldn&apos;t finish. That early fascination evolved into a deep love for computational thinkingâ€”whether it&apos;s wrangling unruly datasets, coaxing neural networks to behave, or finding elegant mathematical solutions to messy biological problems.

      My journey has taken me from writing my first &quot;Hello World&quot; to exploring how we can use machine learning and information theory to decode the beautiful stochasticity of biological systems. I&apos;m particularly excited about bridging the gap between rigorous mathematical models and data-driven approaches, because the best insights often live at the intersection of structure and flexibility.

      When I&apos;m not lost in code or papers, you&apos;ll find me contemplating how the probabilistic cellular automata we call life manages to be both chaotic and remarkably predictable, much like my debugging sessions. Growing up in Nalanda, Bihar, perhaps I inherited a bit of that ancient scholarly tradition of wrestling with complex problems, even if my debugging tools look quite different from those used a millennium ago.
