      # Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
      </p>

      <p>
      I'm a computational enthusiast from Nalanda, Biharâ€”yes, *that* Nalanda, home to one of the world's first residential universities where scholars once debugged philosophical problems instead of code. These days, I'm debugging both!
      </p>

      <p>
      I've been tinkering with computers since childhood, when problem-solving meant figuring out why my code wouldn't compile rather than why my homework wouldn't finish. That early fascination evolved into a deep love for computational thinkingâ€”whether it's wrangling unruly datasets, coaxing neural networks to behave, or finding elegant mathematical solutions to messy biological problems.
      </p>

      <p>
      My journey has taken me from writing my first "Hello World" to exploring how we can use machine learning and information theory to decode the beautiful stochasticity of biological systems. I'm particularly excited about bridging the gap between rigorous mathematical models and data-driven approaches, because the best insights often live at the intersection of structure and flexibility.
      </p>

      <p>
      When I'm not lost in code or papers, you'll find me contemplating how the probabilistic cellular automata we call life manages to be both chaotic and remarkably predictableâ€”much like my debugging sessions.

      Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chat about computational biology, network inference, or the best practices for naming variables!
