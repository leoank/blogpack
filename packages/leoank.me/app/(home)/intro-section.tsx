      I&apos;m a computational enthusiast who&apos;s been playing with computers since childhood,
      when problem-solving meant figuring out videogame puzzles rather than why cells are doing what they are doing.
      That early fascination evolved into a deep love for computational thinking,
      whether it&apos;s building automated systems to process data from billions of cells,
      coaxing neural networks to behave, or finding elegant mathematical solutions to messy biological problems.

      <p className="intro-para-space">
      I am exploring how we can use machine learning and information theory to decode the beautiful stochasticity of biological systems.
      I&apos;m particularly excited about bridging the gap between rigorous mathematical models and data-driven approaches,
      because the best insights often live at the intersection of structure and flexibility.
      </p>
      <p className="intro-para-space">
      When I&apos;m not lost in code or papers, you&apos;ll find me contemplating how the probabilistic cellular automata we call life manages to be both chaotic and remarkably predictable, much like my debugging sessions. Growing up in Nalanda, Bihar, perhaps I inherited a bit of that ancient scholarly tradition of wrestling with complex problems, even if my debugging tools look quite different from those used a millennium ago.
